Hi,

I am a graduate of st josephs bangalore, trained in data science. I love working with data and getting insights from them and creating high quality visualizations for the consumption of the end-users . 

I can code well in Python and work with SQL (intermediate)databases. I am also equipped with good knowledge of Data science, statistics, machine learning algorithms,data mining and visualization,feature engineering and model deployment. I conduct my data analysis mostly using Pandas in Jupyter lab, Google colab and Kaggle kernel. I am also learning BI tools like Power BI and Tableau dashboards and NoSQL databases.
